# javascript_todolist

This is a basic JavaScript todo list, which I developed in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I chose to do this without a framework because I wanted to get a deeper understanding of JavaScript and how it can take user input and store it as a variable the print that variable to a list.

This project also taught me the importance of responsive web design, as this list can be viewed from any browser or device be it mobile, tablet or desktop.

As always this project is 100% open source so feel free to use it in anyway that you want.

If you have any ideas or improve feel free to let me know :)
